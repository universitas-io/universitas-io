PhD student in Political Science at Unicamp, Master, Bachelor, and Licensed in History from UFJF. I also hold a degree in Software Analysis and Development from PUC Minas.

My research focuses mainly on digital social movements, digital humanities, critical internet studies, the interfaces between technology and politics, digital platforms, and their implications in the public sphere.

I have knowledge in web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and ASP.NET, in addition to experience in quantitative and qualitative research, data analysis, processing, and visualization.
